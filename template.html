	  <h2>nodeJS Documentation</h2>
	  <p> nodeJS and Express will be the two servies we will be using in order to run the server side and backend side of our project. The modifications we have to make to the pre-existing code and files is very minimmal as nodeJS allows for little change needed to be done. A public folder will need to be formed in order for the css files to be static and run on a live server. We then have to link the sql, css, and html through a node javascript file. With this then everything should be properally connected.

	<h2>Vision For The Website</h2>
	  <h5>Main Aspects Neccessary For The Design</h5>
	<p>The main vison for the website is accessibility as we want users to have an easy time accessing the website. Due to this, the color scheme should be pleasing to the eye and enjoyable for the user's experience, users should have an easy time page surfing, and instructions on how to interact with the website should be clear and easy to follow. With all these aspects in mind, other factors can be given more liberties to the freedom of the developer desgining in, yet it should still follow the styling and scheme presented in this reference sheet.</p>
